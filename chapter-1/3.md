Here is explanatio why do we need this inbound rules

  0. SSH (22) - enables ability login to any vm via ssh protocol
  0. HTTP (80) - our website-a and website-b will be available through this port to the outside world
  0. All Trafic - with this rule we allow any traffic inside of our subnetwork, so that vms can talk to each other
