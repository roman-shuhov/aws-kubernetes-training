# Launch single ETCD instance

To create new ETCD instance we will use [ETCD cloud config](/files/cloud-configs/etcd.yaml)

You can find command which we need to execute inside "/files/commands/" folder in [create-etcd.sh](/files/commands/create-etcd.sh)

Before you can run this command you need to replace all placeholders with ID of the AWS services, which you created before. You need Security Group ID, Subnet ID, Region (it should be the as for your VPC) and SSH Key Pair name.

After you do this replacement, run this commands:

    chmod +x ./create-etcd.sh
    ./create-etcd.sh

The output of this command should look like 


    {
        "OwnerId": "...",
        "ReservationId": "...",
        "Groups": [],
        "Instances": [
            {
                "Monitoring": {
                    "State": "disabled"
                },
         ...
    }
