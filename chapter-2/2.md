# Verify ETCD setup

First you need to wait while AWS shows that the instance is ready. Go to "Services" - "EC2" and click on "Instances" link under the "Instances" section. you should see your new VM as a first item (if you don't have any sortings of filters applied, in this case you should clear filter and sort instaces by launch date). First several minutes AWS will show it as

![Preparing instance](/assets/2_1.png)

But as soon as it's ready you will see

![Ready instance](/assets/2_2.png)

After that you can try to login into it via ssh with a default "core" user and your SSH key

    ssh core@<ip> -i <path to Private SSH key generated before>
    
After that you will see something like that

    CoreOS alpha (752.1.0)
    Update Strategy: No Reboots
    core@ip-10-0-0-65 ~ $
    
Let's make sure that ETCD is working 

    etcdctl cluster-health

This command should list all ETCD nodes (in our case it's just one) with their status. Output should be like 

    cluster is healthy
    member 4d061a28954e38d7 is healthy

Let's try to store something to the ETCD

    etcdctl set test test
    
And check that it's in place

    etcdctl ls /

Output should be 

    /test
