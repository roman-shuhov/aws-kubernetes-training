# Creating master instance

Go inside of a folder "/files/cloud-configs" and open file [Cloud Config for K8s master](/files/cloud-configs/create-k8s-master.md) 
In this config you need to replace **<etcd ip>** placeholder with an actual IP address. Open list of the instances ("Services" - "EC2" - "Instances") 
and click on the ETCD instance. At the bottom you should see information about this VM, you need Private IP :

Copy it and replace all placeholder. 

The next step is to actually create Kubernetes Master VM. Go to /files/commands folder and execute the following commands:

    chmod +x create-k8s-master.sh
    ./create-k8s-master.sh
  
Expected output is 

    {
        "OwnerId": "...",
        "ReservationId": "...",
        "Groups": [],
        "Instances": [
            {
                "Monitoring": {
                    "State": "disabled"
                },
         ...
    }
