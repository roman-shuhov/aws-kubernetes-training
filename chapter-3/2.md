# Add nodes/slaves/minions to the cluster

To finish Kubernetes cluster setup we need to add nodes to our master. They will actually host our services and serve it to the users.

As a first step you need to get ETCD IP. You can read about it at [Previous article](/chapter-3/1.md)

Moreover, you also need to get Kubernetes Master IP address. Steps are the same as for ETCD IP address.

After that, you can open file [Kubernetes Node Cloud Config](/files/cloud-configs/node.yaml) and replace **\<etcd ip\>** and **\<master ip\>** placeholders 

Then, go to folder "/files/commands" and run the following commands:

    chmod +x create-k8s-nodes.sh
    ./create-k8s-nodes.sh
    
Output should be similar to Kubernetes Master output.
